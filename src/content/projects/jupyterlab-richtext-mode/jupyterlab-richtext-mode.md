learned: "With this extension developed during my time at Project Jupyter, I learned React at a basic level, and learned how to integrate it with a custom-built rich text editor using the ProseMirror toolkit. I was also introduced to the complexity of large codebases and was immediately mortified as to where to find what I needed, but found my place after asking questions through the open source community, my co-interns, and my managers. Although the React code wasn't the most performant, it was an experience meant for growth and left me wanting to learn more. "

An extension for JupyterLab that transforms Markdown cells into rich text-editing cells. The editor for these cells
includes standard formatting options that are supported within Markdown such as bold, italic, and underline, while providing support 
for non-standard Markdown features like syntax highlighting for code blocks and both inline and block-level math equations.
