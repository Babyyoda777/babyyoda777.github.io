learned: "With this React project, I learned how to use D3 at its core as a data-binding tool to create and draw a tree structure from specified input. It was also one of my first projects where I used SASS as a CSS preprocessor and utilized BEM-style CSS. I also learned how to structure my React projects in a way that was more meaningful than listing every component under a components folder."

A React web app that I created with another developer. It visualizes binary trees created from input in a format specified by binarysearch, a collaborative algorithm challenge site. It allows for both inputing a string directly from binarysearch or creating a tree from scratch with interactive controls, and utilizes D3.js to visualize such a tree.
