This was my first job as a frontend-focused web developer. It introduced me to writing responsive HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap to drop in already-built components, and using jQuery 
primarily as a shortcut for DOM manipulation. Whether I was making minor HTML changes, or transforming a design file to a website from scratch, this was an
experience full of growth in regards to learning the fundamental frontend dev languages.
