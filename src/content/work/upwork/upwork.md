Working as a freelance frontend developer for the past few months has been a solid learning experience, whether it be learning how to structure my front-end projects and manage my time more effectively, or just learning new technologies for the job while improving on current skills. I used primarily React to build SPAs, and learned new technologies like TailwindCSS. I was also exposed to working with REST API's and using React Context to manage external data.
