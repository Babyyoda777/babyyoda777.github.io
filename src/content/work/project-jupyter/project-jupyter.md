Project Jupyter was where I had my first work experience with React and TypeScript, and my first time working with a large, open-source codebase implemented with software development patterns that I'd never heard of, like factories. I learned about the power of open source communities and the importance of asking questions to make development in a large organization more approachable. I learned to work closely alongside a UI/UX designer, whether it be collaboratively conducting user research or bouncing ideas off each other.
